<h3>I am a big fan of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.</h3></br>
 I used SeaArt.AI and Midjourney to create an AI-generated picture of ➡️Mark reviewing a Tesla for a YouTube video⬅️</br>
 As I said, I admire Mark and Elon a lot. I hope they can be good friends and collaborate on something amazing.</br>
 Anyway, this was a fun project that I did with the help of SeaArt.AI and Midjourney. I used SeaArt.AI to generate the prompt and Midjourney to swap the faces.</br>
